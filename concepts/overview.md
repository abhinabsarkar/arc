# Overview
Azure Cache for Redis provides low-latency and high-throughput in-memory data store based on the Redis software. It's able to process large volumes of application requests by keeping frequently accessed data in the server memory, which can be written to and read from quickly.

Azure Cache for Redis offers both the Redis open-source (OSS Redis) and a commercial product from Redis Labs (Redis Enterprise) as a managed service. The service is operated by Microsoft, hosted on Azure, and usable by any application within or outside of Azure.

Azure Cache for Redis improves application performance by supporting common application architecture patterns. More can be read about them here - [Key scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview#key-scenarios)
